# Mothersday-Clock

I built this project for a gift for my wife for Mother's Day.  I used the code from andydoro (https://github.com/andydoro/NeoPixel-60-Ring-Clock) to make the clock part work.  

My additions to this project are to add in a second ring that will show how far out 2 other dates are by filling in the ring.  This will update every minute.
